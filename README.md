**tips** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Eugene Damiba**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
A sharing section was added to the first page to provide the user with the option of dividing the tip or the total amount among a certain number of people. The user can specify the number of people, and the contribution of each person is calculated as the bill amount is entred. 
- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
+ Create a list of favorite restaurant to allow the user save the name and address of the restaurant
+ Add the "Apple Pay" button to make the bill payement more convenient for the user.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Given the fact that this was my introduction to swift and app development, the challenges had mainly to do with getting acquainted with the language and app ios app development concepts.
